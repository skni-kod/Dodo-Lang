## General info:
The goal of the project is to create a simple compiled language called Dodo-lang. We are writing it in cpp.
We also want to create own lexer and parser.

## Technologies:
- cpp
- assembly

## About dodo-lang:
This language will have strongly-typed variables. mn() will be main funcion.
And the file extension will be probably .dod because why not :-)
### List of keywords:
- asm
- bool
- break
- char
- const
- dodo...while (u know, dodo instead of do. What a clever joke. This joke is probably the best thing about this language)
- else
- false
- f (float)
- for
- if
- i32 (int)
- ret (return)
- size (sizeof)
- true
- interrupt

### Operands:
- +, -
- =
- ==, !=
- ()
- {}
- []

## Plans:
First we want to achieve compilation. Then we want to add variables and functions.
In the distant future maybe other stuff like objects or sth.
