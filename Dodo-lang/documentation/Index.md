# Dodo-Lang compiler documention

Dodo-Lang is a programming language developed for the purposes of learning within the SKNI "KOD" at Rzesz√≥w University of Technology. The compiler is written in C++ and is able to transform the files into native assembly code which is then assembled and linked into an executable by gnu as and ld.

The conception of the language is for it to treat all it's types as complex objects, allowing the programmer for full freedom in choosing the way it's elements interact with each other. There is no need for a given order of defining structures and header files. The plan is for the compiler to be able to output for x86 and ARM for Linux and Windows.
